This was the #1 request after first publishing this site! No disappointments here. I actually ordered the Bacon Burrito also, which was good but fairly typical. The Machaca Burrito though was very good. The Machaca shredded beef was super tasty, paired great with the bell peppers, and made for a hell of a burrito.

Despite the egg in there, it didn't scream "breakfast" burrito.
