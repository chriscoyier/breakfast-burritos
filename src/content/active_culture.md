Everything Active Culture makes is pretty high quality. Good ingredients, made from scratch, done with care. I'm not sure they promise it, but you get the feeling things are organic and sourced locally. It probably won't blow your socks off (and I'd probably get something else from their overall great menu, honestly), but it's a good burrito. Get the OG sauce for some extra unusual flavor.

This burrito doesn't feel particularly _breakfasty_, despite the eggs.

Beware lots of upsells when ordering. Prosciutto is the only meat option ($2.00 upsell),making it double the cost of most other options.
