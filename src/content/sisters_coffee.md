Excellent, absolutely top-tier breakfast burrito. Busting with flavor. Didn't need any sauce â€” the chipotle source cream does it all. It always helps when you eat a freshly-made burrito like this moments after it comes out of the pan and is wrapped, and the fact that I hanging out at the cafe doing a bit of co-working made it the perfect situation for that.

It's all the way out in Sisters, and that cafe is just massively popular there. I had quite a wait, which would have been more than I wanted if I wasn't just hanging out anyway. There is a Sister's Coffee in the Old Mill, but they don't have a breakfast burrito.
