Damn fine burrito made to order. I've only been this one time, and I have a feeling I scrweed up by going bacon. Somethings tells me I should have gone chile verde and got the green chile sauce, as the bacon wasn't busting with flavor.

I think the cart is only there for a couple months in the summer months. I go by there nearly every day and it's always busy. Good for them, good for business, but it makes getting a burrito a bit slow.
