Damn fine burrito made to order. I've only been this one time, and I have a feeling I scrweed up by going bacon. Somethings tells me I should have gone chile verde and got the green chile sauce, as the bacon wasn't busting with flavor.

I think the cart is only there for a couple months in the summer months. I go by there nearly every day and it's always busy. Good for them, good for business, but it makes getting a burrito a bit slow.

UPDATE: The review above is ~2023. Spring 2025 I ordered the green chile burrito like I always planned. Similarly, it was good in almost every way (service, size, price, quality) except the flavor. It's not a bad flavor it's just fairly bland and really begs you to bring your own hot sauce.
