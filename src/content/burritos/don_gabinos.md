Super solid, perfectly made burrito. I drove by and ordered at the counter so I got it super fresh. Lovely to look at as well, look at those insides! I was almost going to give it a 4, but I think the thing that pushes it up to a 5 is how they make it with the cheese between multiple layers of tortilla wrapper, almost like it's wrapped in a thin quesidilla.

There are something like 6 salsa choices but nothing standout.
