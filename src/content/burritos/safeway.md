Relatively cheap, I guess.

This is a phoned in burrito. They literally make them fresh each morning. I've been there at 6am when the open and have watched them do it. You'd think getting them that fresh would be good, but they are just weak ingredients slapped together with no vision at all. I hate to imagine what they are like by noon. Everything about them is bad surrounded by a dry tortilla.
