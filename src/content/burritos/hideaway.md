The Hideaway wasn't on my list, I just happened in there with some friends the other day for brunch and they had the burrito on the menu and I felt compelled. I'm glad I did as it was very well done! I feel like the food at Hideaway is way better than it has any business being (it's a dark sports bar!) but it's sister restaurant is The Victorian Cafe so I guess that makes sense. Four stars only because it didn't do anything above and beyond or unique.

This isn't rare or inherently bad, but it falls into the category of "we already make all the stuff that goes in this burrito for other dishes, so we scoop them into a tortilla as an option too." Price is a little high too, but it comes with a side.
