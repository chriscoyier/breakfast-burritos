The little round hash brown thingies that come with the meal are pretty OK.

It's just a soggy sloppy kinda gross tasting burrito. Sorry Burger King, the Whopper is a very decent fast food burger and since it's available for breakfast, if you find yourself at a Burger King for breakfast, just do that.
