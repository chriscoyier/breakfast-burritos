This might be my winner.

It's eighteen bucks. It's only available on weekends from 10am-2pm. A server brings it to you. Those things are very different from a lot of the burritos on this site. But maybe that's what it takes to be the best. Washington has a big beautiful kitchen and they clearly use it here.

The proportions are key. The tater tots give it just the right crunch without overdoing the potato element. The black beans add some color and protein without being too bean-y. I would have thought internal pico would be too watery, but it balances it all and brings freshness. The flavor is there, helped a bit by the house salsa that comes with it. I did require a second cup of that.
