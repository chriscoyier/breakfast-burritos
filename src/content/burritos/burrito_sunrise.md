(Update: this review was from when that big yellow truck was over on Greenwood. It's now at Campfire Hotel on 3rd, so I updated the address.)

My fourth time was a charm here. The Supreme Burrito was a damn fine take. Where Bend Breakfast Burrito kinda mixes all the burrito filling ingredients together making it homogenous (but great), Burrito Sunrise keeps all the ingredients very separate but layered. It's the difference between crafting/grilling the burritos on the spot (Burrito Sunrise), and making them well ahead of time (Bend Breakfast Burrito). I'm fond of them both, but I think it's fair to say a Burrito Sunrise has a higher peak-deliciousness point (one minute after they give it to you), and fades quickly, where Bend Breakfast Burrito remains delicious for hours/days. In other words, don't take your Burrito Sunrise burrito to the mountain.

This place has all the burrito buzz right now. Perhaps because of the iconic yellow truck right on Greenwood. It took me four tries to find a burrito I found worthy of the buzz. I've had The Hog, The Carne Asade, and The Chorizo and I didn't like _any_ of them. Fortunately, the one I've found here is damn good.

My main gripe is it's always the same fella who I order from, and I find him a bit curt in a way that I'm not used to in Bend. No greeting, he just waits for you to speak when you get to the counter. And one time I asked for Jalepenos on the side (rather than doing the add-spice add-on thing they do to the burrio itself) and was told _"do you have a way to grill them and apply them internally to the burrito where you are going?"_ and I was like _"uhhhhh, no"_, and I didn't get them. Jeez sorry for asking.
