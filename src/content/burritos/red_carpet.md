Red Carpet is a... car wash. So, ya know, better than expected. I thought it was rice in there at first and didn't really see any eggs so assumed at first it was not really a breakfast burrito. But I think it was hash browns in the end and there were a light amount of eggs involved after all. I wouldn't go out of your way for it but it's nice to have when you're captive there for 45 minutes while they full service the truck.
