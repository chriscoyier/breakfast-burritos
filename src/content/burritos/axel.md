I had never heard of this joint, but I was in the mood for a breakfast burrito and checked Uber Eats and there it was. Like so many of these burritos, it doesn't seem to be trying to do anything special, it's just a very decent burrito. I thought they did a fine job with it. It's in the bring-your-own-hot-sauce category, as it needs it and their provided ones weren't terribly flavorful.

As a bonus, I got their guac, which I found quite sub-par, and a couple of their rolled-tacos, which were well above par.
