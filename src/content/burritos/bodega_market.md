I've whined that ever since Bond Street Market closed years ago now there hasn't been a single quick little store downtown. But now since Bodega Market opened in
October 2023, my whining is over. Now there is a quick little store and it's excellent out of the gate.

I tried the meat one first, which features a sort of pork and onion sauté with wonderful flavor. But incredibly I prefered the veggie one I tried in a second visit — a hearty mixture of things you probably wouldn't expect in a breakfast burrito, including cauliflower.

The best feature, aside from the fact you can walk in the door and walk out with a burrito in 30 seconds, is the egg _wrap_ just inside the tortilla, ensuring even satisfying egg content throughout, rather than the typical scramble style.

Very well done and highly recommended. The Barrio hot sauces are tasty but run a little sweet for my breakfast burrito tastes, so BYO Cholula.
