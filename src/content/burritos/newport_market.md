I forgot to look at my receipt so that price might be wrong. It's just a typical grocery story breakfast burrito though. I bought it at like 10am and it was probably make 4 hours ago and got a bit soggy. Thems the dice you roll at a grocery store hotbox. Literally nothing standout all all about it, but I'll say the potato/egg ratio was correct.
