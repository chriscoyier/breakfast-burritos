This came highly recommended as "the best hot case in town". I rolled over there about 8:30am on a Monday morning hoping I would catch them at a pretty fresh point. I hate to say it but it was just kinda bad. The eggs and the bacon were burnt which nothing could save it from.

It is a nice gas station and other things in the hot case looked fine, so I'd be willing to give it another shot, but on this partular Monday it was very much not worth the drive.

I also just had to guess at 7.00. Might have been cheaper, I just can't remember and they don't exactly have an online menu.
