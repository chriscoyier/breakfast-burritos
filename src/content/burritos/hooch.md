I stopped by quite early one morning as I randomly drove by and remembered it was high on my list. This is the place that took over The Breakfast Club on Greenwood. They did quite a nice remodel inside, keeping the bar look but making it a proper bar, blemished a bit by it looking a bit unkempt.

I was the only person in there and it was a bit awkward. I'm thinking it's going for more of a lunch/dinner thing. With a tip I think it ended up at like $25 for a burrio-and-that's-it. Then I left and [the sign outside](https://share.cleanshot.com/thD4qRhg) said "home of the $6 breakfast burrito" and I was like WTF?

It was an OK burrito I guess but the experience was too weird to give it anymore than 3 stars. I'll need to try it again another time, maybe the dine-in experience is the way to go.
