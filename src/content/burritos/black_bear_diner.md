The price includes a heaping helping of a side, plus fruit. I enjoyed the country potatoes more than the burrito.

It was quite burned, both the eggs and tortilla on the inside. I can't imagine that's normal, but that's how mine came.

I like chorizo, but I think it's an odd choice for an only choice at a joint like Black Bear Diner where they could clearly pull off a bacon-based version.
