Certainly a made-to-order burrito, as I waited over half an hour for it in the drive through, like they totally forgot about it. They are nice but disorganized.

I'd say it was nearly worth the wait as it certainly was hot and fresh. A solid, well-done burrito â€” just nothing particularly special about it.

Need to try the Bronco next time with the Refried Beans, Sour Cream and Fresh Avocado Slices.
