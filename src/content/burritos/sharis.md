I was expecting this to be bad. I actually love Shari's in general so it's not that. I just figured it would be phoned in. They have hash browns, eggs, and sausage anyway, so why not just spatula them into a tortilla and flesh out the menu? But this has more care than that. There is a sauce on it that's uniquely for the burrito (best I can tell) that is quite good. Hash browns as the potatoes in the burrito is more rare than you'd think in Bend and it really works here, along with the chopped bacon that was cooked perfectly burrito usage. I'm a fan of getting sour cream and a kinda "normal" salsa automatically with burritos, and that's exactly what they do here.

I enjoy how Shari's is ruthless about their mask mandate. Literally every time I'm there there is always multiple people who come in maskless and someone calls them out on it and they either leave or put one on. I just find that comforting. If you have a rule, and the rule is posted on the door, enforce the rule. If they put a rule that said everyone had to wear purple hat to come in, I'd wear a damn purple hat.

I've been to Shari's maybe a half dozen times the last few months and they seem to be constantly struggling with short staff, computer issues, and whatever else that causes wait times and slow service. They always seem like they are doing their best to overcome it, and this struggle isn't unique, I just point it out as feedback.
