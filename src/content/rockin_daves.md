Unique take on a breakfast burrito! I've literally never seen a sausuage gravy smothered breakfast burrito before. Sauce-covered burritos for lunch, sure, but this was a cool approach. Well made and tasty, if a bit of a gut bomb. My favorite part is the diced biscuit chunks within the burrito itself.

Not the world's biggest fans of the sausage. Weirdly perfectly rectangular bits, giving off an extra-processed vibe. Mr. Dave's spot is also super popular! I had to abort mission one morning as the line was nuts. I ultimately did Uber Eats on a weekday lunch.
