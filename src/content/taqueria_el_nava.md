This joint is tucked behind Bevel in the little food court back there. I'm not in love with Bevel beer, but I like their style and I like the physical location. And they have good taste in food trucks. From what I've seen come and go from there, it's all pretty good.

From the outside, Taqueria El Nava looks a lot like any other kitchen-sink-style Mexican cart (they have hot dogs, chicken teriaky bowls, french fries, and all sorts of stuff in addition to a thick Mexican menu). That heavy of a menu is normally a red flag to me, but I've had nothing but good food from there, including the Bacon Breakfast Burrito.

I really dig the use of french fries as the potato. I think that's unique in Bend, at least in my travels so far. It's big, it's fresh, and it's well-crafted. I've tried it twice, and it was equally good both times. It's not a 5 because it doesn't offer any terribly unique flavors on its own. It _begs_ for hot sauce â€” so I recommend bringing your own favorite to the party.

They also only open at 10am so it's a bit late for breakfast for me normally, but thankfully they serve them anytime.
