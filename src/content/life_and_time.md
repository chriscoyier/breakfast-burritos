### The Good

There is a really tangy and tasty sauce in there. I buy the hype that only buy and use high quality clean ingredients.

### The Bad

The dryest of the burritos around. I feel like I should have got the sweet potato version. The sauce, while good, doesn't feel particularly well distributed and leaves the dry ingredients (particularly the small-cut potatoes) particularly dry.
