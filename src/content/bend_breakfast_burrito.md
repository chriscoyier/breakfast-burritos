### The Good

You'd hope a place called "Bend Breakfast Burrito" would make a killer breakfast burrito. Good news: they do. I like how the burrito stuffing is so _equalized_, almost like they make a huge casserole of burrito guts and inject it into the tortilla. They are not made fresh, but that can be an advantage. Since they are designed to last, you can absolutely buy one to eat later in the day or the next day.

Get the delicious avocado crema, it's much better than the (unfortunately lackluster) salsas that come with it. Otherwise it begs for Cholula.

The bowl is also great, and they do fun limited time offer things that are usually worth getting.

### The Bad

While the burritos are quite consistent, ordering them is not. Since the beginning you never really know where they are going to be. Instagram is the best way to find them, and it seems to change every week.

It's on the small size compared to other local burritos.

The filling mixture I know is a turnoff for some. It's certainly a unique approach.
